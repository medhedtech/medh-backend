# AWS SDK v3 Migration Plan

This document outlines the steps required to migrate from AWS SDK v2 to AWS SDK v3 in the MEDH backend application.

## Completed Changes

1. ✅ **Update AWS Configuration**
   - Replaced monolithic AWS SDK v2 import with modular AWS SDK v3 imports in `config/aws-config.js`
   - Created client instances for S3, SNS, and SES
   - Added helper functions for common operations

2. ✅ **Update S3 Service**
   - Updated `utils/s3Service.js` to use AWS SDK v3 APIs
   - Replaced stream creation approach
   - Updated presigned URL generation

3. ✅ **Update Package Dependencies**
   - Added required AWS SDK v3 packages to `package.json`
   - Removed outdated AWS SDK v2 package

## Remaining Changes

4. **Update Email Service**
   - Update `services/emailService.js` to use SES client from AWS SDK v3 instead of v2
   - This might not be necessary if currently using nodemailer

5. **Test All AWS Functionality**
   - Test S3 file uploads and downloads
   - Test SES email sending
   - Test SNS notifications (if used)

## Migration Benefits

1. **Modular Architecture**: AWS SDK v3 uses a modular approach, reducing bundle size by only including the services you need
2. **Middleware Stack**: AWS SDK v3 introduces a middleware stack that allows you to customize request processing
3. **Promises First**: AWS SDK v3 is designed with Promises as the primary async pattern, no more `.promise()` calls
4. **Better TypeScript Support**: AWS SDK v3 has improved TypeScript definitions
5. **Active Development**: AWS SDK v3 is actively maintained while v2 is in maintenance mode

## Potential Issues

1. **API Changes**: Some API methods and parameters have changed between v2 and v3
2. **Credentials Handling**: The way credentials are managed has changed
3. **Stream Handling**: Stream handling is different in v3, requiring adaptation
4. **Error Handling**: Error structures and handling patterns have changed
