# Certificate Template Reference

## 📁 Purpose
This folder is for storing your certificate template reference image. 

## 📋 Instructions
1. **Place your certificate template image here** - This will serve as the reference for updating the certificate design
2. **Supported formats**: PNG, JPG, JPEG, SVG
3. **Recommended filename**: `certificate-template-reference.png` (or .jpg/.jpeg)

## 🎯 What to do next
Once you've placed your reference image in this folder, let me know:
- The filename of your reference image
- What specific changes you want me to make to match your template
- Any particular elements that need to be adjusted (layout, colors, fonts, positioning, etc.)

## 📂 Current folder structure
```
public/images/certificate-template/
├── README.md
└── [Your reference image will go here]
```

## 🔧 How it works
After you place your reference image, I can:
- Analyze the design elements
- Update the certificate template CSS and HTML
- Match colors, fonts, layout, and positioning
- Ensure the generated certificates match your reference design

**Ready to proceed!** Just place your certificate template image in this folder and let me know the filename.
