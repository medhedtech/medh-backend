# CloudFront Logging Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed ✅

**Problem**: The CloudFront fallback was logging the warning message for every single video file, creating excessive console noise.

**Before Fix**:

```
CloudFront private key not loaded. Returning unsigned URL as fallback.

```

**After Fix**:

```
[cloudfrontSigner] CloudFront private key not loaded. Using unsigned URLs as fallback.
```

## Solution Implemented 🛠️

### 1. Added Warning Tracking

```javascript
let hasLoggedWarning = false; // Track if we've already logged the warning
```

### 2. Modified Warning Logic

```javascript
if (!privateKey) {
  if (!hasLoggedWarning) {
    console.warn(
      "[cloudfrontSigner] CloudFront private key not loaded. Using unsigned URLs as fallback.",
    );
    hasLoggedWarning = true;
  }
  return url; // Return unsigned URL as fallback
}
```

### 3. Added Reset Function

```javascript
export const resetCloudFrontWarning = () => {
  hasLoggedWarning = false;
};
```

## Benefits 🎯

- **Reduced Noise**: Only one warning message per application session
- **Better UX**: Cleaner console output for developers
- **Maintained Functionality**: All videos still work with unsigned URLs
- **Testing Support**: Reset function for testing scenarios

## Files Modified

- **utils/cloudfrontSigner.js**: Added warning tracking and reset function
- **test-cloudfront-signing.js**: Updated to use reset function for clean testing

## Current Status 📊

- ✅ **Fixed**: Excessive logging noise
- ✅ **Working**: Graceful fallback to unsigned URLs
- ✅ **Clean**: Single warning message per session
- ✅ **Functional**: All video endpoints working properly

## Testing Results ✅

```bash
$ node test-cloudfront-signing.js
