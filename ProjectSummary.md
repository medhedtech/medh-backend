# MEDH Backend Project Summary

## Overview
The MEDH backend is a Node.js/Express API for managing courses, brochures, and related educational resources. The system follows a standard MVC architecture with controllers, models, and routes.

## Key Components

### Brochure Management
- **Purpose**: Handle course brochure requests, distribution, and analytics
- **Main Files**: 
  - controllers/brouchers-controller.js
  - models/broucker-model.js
- **Key Features**:
  - Brochure creation and storage
  - Email delivery of brochures to interested users
  - Analytics tracking for brochure downloads
  - Search and filter functionality for administrative views

### Course Management
- **Purpose**: Manage course catalog, details, and related operations
- **Main Files**:
  - controllers/course-controller.js
  - models/course-model.js
- **Key Features**:
  - Course CRUD operations
  - Filtering and search capabilities
  - Status management (toggle active/inactive)
  - Related courses functionality

## Technical Standards

### API Response Format
- Standard format: `{ success: boolean, message: string, data: object }`
- Error format: `{ success: false, message: string, error: string }`
- Pagination: `{ data: { items: [], totalItems: number, totalPages: number, currentPage: number } }`

### Validation Approach
- Input validation before processing
- ObjectId validation using utility functions
- Required fields checking
- Error messages tailored to each validation failure

### Error Handling
- Consistent try/catch blocks with error logging
- Detailed error messages in development
- Generic, user-friendly messages in production
- Status codes aligned with HTTP standards

## Architectural Patterns

### Controllers
- Follow RESTful patterns
- Contain CRUD operations
- Include filtering capabilities
- Implement pagination where appropriate

### Models
- MongoDB schemas with validation
- Relationships between entities (e.g., course â†’ brochures)
- Timestamps for auditing

### Routes
- Organized by resource type
- Authentication/authorization middleware
- Parameter validation

## Recent Improvements

- Enhanced error handling and validation
- Added analytics capabilities for brochure downloads
- Implemented consistent pagination and filtering patterns
- Improved documentation with JSDoc comments
