## controllers/brouchers-controller.js Improvements

1. **General Structure Improvements**
   - Added JSDoc comments for better documentation
   - Standardized response formats with success flag
   - Added detailed error messages and better error handling
   - Included consistent data format in responses

2. **Input Validation**
   - Added required field validation
   - Added ObjectId validation using validateObjectId helper

3. **Response Format Standardization**
   - Used consistent success/failure response format
   - Wrapped response data in a data object
   - Added detailed error messages

4. **Feature Enhancements**
   - Added pagination for getAllBrouchers
   - Added filtering by email, course title, and date range
   - Improved update functionality with conditional course handling
   - Fixed spelling of "attachments" (was "attachements")

5. **New Features**

   - Added categorization by course, total downloads, and daily tracking

These improvements align the brouchers-controller.js file with the patterns and best practices found in course-controller.js, making the codebase more consistent and maintainable.

## Brochure Download Endpoint Fix (March 8, 2025)

### Issue
The brochure download endpoint was returning a 404 error with the message "Invalid route" when the frontend attempted to access `/api/v1/broucher/download/:courseId`.

### Root Cause
1. The route was incorrectly registered as `/api/v1/brouchers` (with an 's') in routes/index.js, while the frontend was requesting `/api/v1/broucher`.
2. The nested path structure in the route registration was incorrect - it included "/api/v1" in the path even though this prefix was already being added in the main app.

### Changes Made
1. Fixed the route registration in routes/index.js by changing the path from "/api/v1/brouchers" to "/broucher"
2. Added missing mongoose import in index.js to fix a graceful shutdown error
3. Created test scripts to validate the functionality:
   - test-brochure.js: Tests the brochure download endpoint
   - list-courses.js: Helper script to find valid course IDs for testing

### Outcome
The brochure download endpoint now works correctly and returns the expected response with the brochure URL.

## Brochure Download Endpoint Enhancement (March 8, 2025)

### Issue
The original issue of 404 "Invalid route" errors when accessing the brochure download endpoint was resolved, but we identified a second issue: the frontend was using GET requests, while the endpoint only supported POST.

### Changes Made
1. Added support for both GET and POST methods on the `/api/v1/broucher/download/:courseId` endpoint
2. Updated the controller to handle both methods differently:
   - GET: Returns just the download link without requiring user data or sending emails
   - POST: Maintains full functionality with user data collection and email sending

### Benefits
1. Improved compatibility with frontend code
2. More flexible API that supports multiple use cases
3. Maintains backward compatibility with existing code
