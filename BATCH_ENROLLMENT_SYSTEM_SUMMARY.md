- Automatic discount application (early bird, group discounts)
- Multi-currency support
- Custom discount codes support

### 3. **Enhanced Payment Integration**

## üí∞ Pricing Logic Flow

### Individual Enrollment Pricing
```
Base Price (Individual) 
    ‚Üì
Apply Early Bird Discount (if available)
    ‚Üì
Apply Custom Discounts
    ‚Üì
Final Price = Base Price - Total Discounts
```

### Batch Enrollment Pricing
```
Base Price (Batch)
    ‚Üì
Apply Group Discount (if batch size ‚â• minimum)
    ‚Üì
Apply Custom Discounts
    ‚Üì
Final Price = Base Price - Total Discounts
```

## üîÑ Enrollment Creation Flow

### 1. Prerequisites Validation
- ‚úÖ Student exists and is valid
- ‚úÖ Course exists and is available
- ‚úÖ No existing active enrollment
- ‚úÖ Batch exists and has capacity (for batch enrollments)

### 2. Pricing Calculation
- Calculate base price based on enrollment type
- Apply automatic discounts
- Apply custom discounts
- Store pricing snapshot for audit trail

### 3. Payment Processing
- Create Razorpay order
- Verify payment signature
- Record payment details
- Activate enrollment

### 4. Enrollment Activation
- Set appropriate access expiry date
- Configure batch information
- Initialize progress tracking

## üéì Enrollment Types Comparison

| Feature | Individual Enrollment | Batch Enrollment |
|---------|----------------------|------------------|
| **Learning Style** | Self-paced | Instructor-led |
| **Batch Assignment** | None | Required |
| **Access Duration** | 1 year (configurable) | Batch end date + 30 days |
| **Pricing** | Individual price | Batch price (usually lower) |
| **Discounts** | Early bird | Group discounts |
| **Schedule** | Flexible | Fixed batch schedule |
| **Instructor** | Optional | Assigned to batch |
| **Capacity** | Unlimited | Limited by batch capacity |

## üîß Integration Examples

### Frontend Integration

#### Get Course Pricing
```javascript
// Individual pricing
const response = await fetch('/api/enhanced-payments/course-pricing/courseId?enrollment_type=individual');

// Batch pricing with group discount
const response = await fetch('/api/enhanced-payments/course-pricing/courseId?enrollment_type=batch&batch_size=10');
```

#### Create Enrollment
```javascript
const orderData = {
  course_id: 'courseId',
  enrollment_type: 'batch',
  batch_id: 'batchId',
  batch_size: 5,
  currency: 'INR'
};

const order = await fetch('/api/enhanced-payments/create-enrollment-order', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(orderData)
});
```

## üìä Database Schema Enhancements

### Enhanced Enrollment Model
```javascript
{
  // Core enrollment data
  student: ObjectId,
  course: ObjectId,
  batch: ObjectId,                    // null for individual enrollments
  enrollment_type: String,            // 'individual' or 'batch'
  
  // Pricing snapshot (audit trail)
  pricing_snapshot: {
    original_price: Number,
    final_price: Number,
    currency: String,
    pricing_type: String,
    discount_applied: Number,
    discount_code: String
  },
  
  // Batch-specific information
  batch_info: {
    batch_size: Number,
    is_batch_leader: Boolean,
    batch_members: [StudentReference]
  },
  
  // Payment and progress tracking
  payments: [PaymentSchema],
  progress: ProgressSchema,
  access_expiry_date: Date,
  status: String
}
```

{ student: 1, course: 1, enrollment_type: 1 }  // Student enrollments
{ batch: 1 }                            // Batch enrollments
{ status: 1 }                           // Status filtering
